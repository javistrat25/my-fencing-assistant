Here’s a clear summary of your project, what’s been accomplished so far, and the next steps:

---

## **Project Goal**
Build an executive assistant app for a fencing company that:
- Integrates with Go High Level (GHL) to manage leads, contacts, opportunities, calendars, and workflows.
- Provides a dashboard and (eventually) an AI chatbot to help the team stay organized, track the customer journey, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

---

## **Work Done So Far**

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Node.js/Express backend created.
   - Environment variables managed with `.env` for security.

2. **Go High Level OAuth Integration**
   - Implemented the full OAuth 2.0 flow:
     - `/auth` route starts the OAuth process.
     - `/auth/callback` handles the redirect and exchanges the code for access/refresh tokens.
   - Tokens are stored persistently in `tokens.json` so you don’t have to re-authenticate every time.

3. **Automatic Token Refresh**
   - If the access token expires, the backend automatically uses the refresh token to get a new one and updates `tokens.json`.

4. **API Endpoints for GHL Data**
   - Created backend routes to pull data from GHL using your access token:
     - `/api/ghl/contacts`
     - `/api/ghl/conversations`
     - `/api/ghl/calendars`
     - `/api/ghl/workflows`
   - All endpoints use the latest access token and will auto-refresh if needed.

5. **Error Handling**
   - If no access token is available, the API prompts you to authenticate via OAuth.
   - If token exchange fails, clear error messages are shown.

## **Goals Moving Forward**

1. **Frontend Dashboard**
   - Build a user-friendly dashboard (React or similar) to display and interact with GHL data.
   - Features: search, filter, view customer journey, manage tasks, etc.

2. **AI Chatbot Integration**
   - Add a chatbot interface to answer team questions and help with data entry or reminders.

3. **Additional Integrations**
   - (Future) Integrate with QuickBooks or other tools as needed.

4. **User Authentication (Optional)**
   - Add login/logout for your team if you want to restrict access.

5. **Polish and Deploy**
   - Improve error handling, add logging, and prepare for deployment.

---

## **What To Do Next (After Restart)**
- Start your backend server:
  ```sh
  cd ~/my-fencing-assistant/backend
  npm run dev
  ```
- Visit `http://localhost:4000/auth` in your browser to authenticate with GHL.
- Use the API endpoints to pull data from your GHL account.
- Let me know when you’re ready to start on the frontend or add more features!
